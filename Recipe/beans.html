        Description
    </h2>
    <p>
       Slow cooker pinto beans are tender, delicious, and easy! I developed this fabulous crockpot recipe after finding too many hard,
        uncooked beans after cooking in a pot on the stove. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There's nothing more convenient than a set-and-forget meal in the slow cooker. And just when you think it can't get any better — how about a hearty set-and-forget meal that will be your new favorite comfort food? 
        It all starts with a package of dried pinto beans.
